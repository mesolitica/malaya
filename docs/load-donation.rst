Initiatives
-----------

1. Pay B2 storage and egress! I store checkpoints and big dataset inside
   B2.
2. Pay linguists to validate my dataset and corpus improving active
   learning.
3. Maintaining and developing new features to all these projects takes a
   considerable amount of time and ``universal exchange``, and I am
   currently exploring the possibility of working on Malaya full time.
