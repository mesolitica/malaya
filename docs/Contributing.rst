Contributing
============

We use `AutoPEP8`_ for code formatting and standardization. Check out the `pyproject.toml`_ file at root directory.

Report Bugs
-----------

Report bugs through `Github issue`_.

Please report all relevant information and preferably code that exhibits the
problem.

Do not try to email us about the issues, we will not respond to any emails, submit a proper Github issue instead.

Fix Bugs
--------

Look through the `Github issue`_ for bugs. Anything is open to whoever

Implement Features
------------------

Look through the `Github issue`_ or `Malaya-project`_ for feature requests. Any
unassigned ``improvement`` issue is open to whoever wants to implement

We use Pytorch and heavily use HuggingFace Transformers as backend.
